    "### Returns and First Passage Times ###\n",
    "Throughout this section we will assume that $X_0, X_1, X_2, \\ldots $ is an irreducible aperiodic Markov Chain with a finite state space. We will start by listing some facts about the number of times this chain visits each state. We won't prove the facts but will indicate why they are true. You should know the facts even if you don't study the sketched justifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For large $n$, all elements of the $n$-step transition matrix are positive. That is, for sufficiently large $n$, $P_n(i, j) > 0$ for all $i$ and $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this is true, remember that for each pair of states $i$ and $j$, the sequence $P_n(i, j)$ converges to $\\pi(j) > 0$ as $n$ gets large. Therefore the terms in the sequence are positive for large $n$. As there is a finite number of pairs of states, there is a finite number of sequences of transition probabilities, and so after some large enough $n$, all the $n$-step transition probabilities are positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each state is visited infinitely many times with probability 1. We say that each state is *recurrent*. As all the states are recurrent, we say for short that *the chain is recurrent*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that because the state space is finite, at least one state has to be visited infinitely often. It can be derived from this that since all states communicate with each other, all states must be visited infinitely often.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix any states $i$ and $j$ (which could be the same). Given that the chain starts at $i$, the expected time till it reaches $j$ is finite. In particular, given that the chain starts at $i$, the expected return time to $i$ is finite. We say that all states are *positive recurrent*, and hence that the *chain is positive recurrent*. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this is true, note from above that for any state $i$, there is some time $n^*$ for which $P_n^*(i, i)$ is positive. Start the chain at $i$ and watch the chain only at times that are multiples of $n^*$. At these times, the number of moves till the chain returns to $i$ is a geometric random variable with a positive \"success\" probability $P_{n^*}(i, i)$, and hence it has finite expectation. If you watch the chain at all times, not just at multiples of $n^*$, it will return to $i$ even faster.\n",

    "To understand what this result is saying, suppose $\\pi(i) = 1/10$. Then you know that in the long run the chain spends $1/10$ of its time at $i$. Since it's at $i$ at one of every 10 steps on average, it makes sense that once the chain is at $i$ you expect it to return to $i$ in 10 steps. This is not a proof by any means, but it confirms that the result is consistent with intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result is analogous to, but not the same as, the fact that in i.i.d. Bernoulli $(p)$ trials, the expected long run proportion of successes is $p$, and the expected number of trials till the first success is $1/p$."
