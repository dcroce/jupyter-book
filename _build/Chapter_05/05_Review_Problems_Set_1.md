## Review Problem Set 1

These problems can be solved using the main ideas of Chapters 1 through 5. It is divided into two parts: The Basics, and Additional Practice. The first part will remind you of the fundamental concepts and some typical calculations. The rest are for you to further develop your problem solving skills and your fluency with the notation and ideas.

### The Basics

**1.**
A procedure for estimating a parameter is based on random sampling and has a 95% chance of producing a good estimate. Suppose I run this procedure $n$ times such that the results of all the different runs have no effect on each other. What is the chance that at least one of the $n$ estimates is **not** good?

**2.**
A monkey hits the keys of a typewriter at random, picking each of the 26 letters of the English alphabet uniformly each time regardless of what it has picked at all other times.

(a) What is the chance that the first six letters are ORANGE, in that order?

(b) What is the chance that the first six letters can form the word ORANGE, by rearrangement if necessary?

**3.**
A die is rolled 8 times. Say whether each of the following statements is true or false. If you say it is false, provide the correct chance.

(a) The chance that all 8 rolls show the face with four spots is $(1/6)^8$.

(b) The chance that all 8 rolls show the same face is $(1/6)^8$.

**4.**
Box A contains 1 black and 3 white marbles, and box B contains 2 black and 4 white marbles. A box is selected at random, then a marble is drawn at random from the selected box. Given that the marble is black, find the probability that Box A was chosen.

**5.**
There are 30 students enrolled in a lab. Find the chance that at least one student has the same birthday as the instructor’s, assuming that the instructor’s birthday is a fixed day and every student’s birthday is equally likely to be any of 365 days of the year regardless of everyone else’s birthday.

**6.**
A die is rolled six times. Find the chance that all six faces appear.

**7.**
A bag contains $m$ M&M's, of which $g$ are green, $r$ red, and $b$ brown. There are no other colors, so $m = g+r+b$. Assume $m \ge 10$. I pick 10 M&M's at random **without** replacement. 

(a) What is the chance that the tenth M&M I pick is green?

(b) What is the chance that second M&M I pick is red and the tenth is green?

**8.**
A coin that lands heads with chance 1/1000 is tossed 2500 times. Find the chance that all the tosses show tails. Find an approximation to this chance in terms of $e$.

**9.**
A population consists of 20 people, of whom 8 are women and 12 are men. A simple random sample of 5 people will be drawn from the population. Which of the following is the chance that the sample contains exactly 3 women? Why?

(i) $$\frac{\binom{8}{3}}{\binom{20}{5}}$$


(ii) $$\frac{\binom{8}{3} \binom{12}{2}}{\binom{20}{5}}$$

**10.**
A standard deck consists of 52 cards. There are 13 cards in each of four suits. Cards are dealt one by one at random without replacement from the deck. Let $X$ be the number of cards dealt till the first time any suit appears more than once. For example, if the sequence of suits is Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Diamonds then $X = 4$. Find the distribution of $X$.

**11.**
In a box of numbered tickets, 20% of the tickets are numbered 0, 30% are numbered 1, and 50% are numbered 2. Two tickets are drawn from the box at random with replacement. Let $M$ be the maximum and $S$ the sum of the two numbers drawn.

(a) Find the joint distribution of $M$ and $S$.

(b) Find the conditional distribution of $S$ given $M = 1$.

**12.**
A roulette wheel has 38 pockets. Of these, 18 are red, 18 black, and 2 green. 
The wheel is spun 20 times. 
Assume that on each spin, each pocket is equally likely to appear; and assume that the spins are independent of each other. 
Find the probability that all three colors appear.

### Additional Practice

**15.**
A lie detector is known to be reliable 80% of the time when the person is guilty, and 90% reliable when the person is innocent. A suspect is chosen at random from a group of suspects of whom only 1% have ever committed a crime. If the test indicates that the suspect is guilty, what is the probability that the suspect is innocent?

**16.**
Assume as usual that if events $A$ and $B$ in a probability space are mutually exclusive, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$. Show by the method of induction that 

$$
P(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i) ~ = ~ \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i) ~~~~~ \mbox{if } A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \mbox{ are mutually exclusive}
$$

**17.**
The multiplication rule says that $P(A_1A_2) = P(A_1)P(A_2 \vert A_1)$. 
Use induction to show that for events $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, 

$$
P(A_1A_2 \ldots A_n) ~ = ~ P(A_1)P(A_2 \vert A_1)P(A_3 \vert A_1A_2) \cdots P(A_n \vert A_1A_2 \ldots A_{n-1})
$$

**18.**
There are three boxes, each with two drawers. Box 1 has a gold coin in each drawer and box 2 has a silver coin in each drawer. Box 3 has a silver coin in one drawer and a gold coin in the other. One box is chosen at random, and then a drawer is chosen at random from the box. Find the probability that box 1 is chosen, given that the chosen drawer yields a gold coin.

**24.**
A deck of five cards contains two aces and three queens. The five cards are shuffled and dealt one by one. This problem is about the number of cards dealt till the aces appear. For example, if the order of the cards dealt was QAQQA, then the number of cards dealt until the first ace is $2$, and until the second ace is $5$.

Three events $A$, $B$, and $C$ are subsets of an outcome space. Let $N$ be the number of these events that occur. The goal of this problem is to find the distribution of $N$ in terms of the probabilities $P(A)$, $P(B)$, $P(C)$, $P(AB)$, $P(AC)$, $P(BC)$, and $P(ABC)$ only; no complements. Do this in the following steps.

**37.**
There are $n$ GSIs and $m$ different slots for office hours. Assume $n \ge m$. Suppose each GSI selects a slot uniformly at random, independently of all the other GSIs. What is the chance that none of the slots is left unselected?

**38.**
*Polya's urn scheme* is a model for contagion and is used in many different contexts. At the start, the urn has $w$ white balls and $b$ blue balls. Every minute, one ball is drawn at random from the urn and then replaced in the urn along with $d$ additional balls of its color. Let $B_n$ be the event that the ball drawn at the $n$th minute is blue. Let's define the 0th minute to be the start, so that $P(B_1) = b/(w+b)$.

(a) Find $P(B_2)$. Make sure you simplify the answer as much as possible; you will see why.

(b) Guess a formula for $P(B_n)$ and prove it by induction.
